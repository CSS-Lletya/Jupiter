# Jupiter
A open source #727 protocol - Simplicity &amp; smarter design. A great learning experience!
Jupiter is an open source #727 Matrix-based base. I personaly found that the 718 caches out there asuaully broken in more than one way. #727 revision came out in 2012. Not too far off from 718 but had seen some more game upddates since.
